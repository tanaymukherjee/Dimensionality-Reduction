# Dimensionality-Reduction
In statistics, machine learning, and information theory, dimensionality reduction or dimension reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. Approaches can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction.

## Key Undertakings:

- Random projection:
In mathematics and statistics, random projection is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a set of points which lie in Euclidean space. Random projection methods are known for their power, simplicity, and low error rates when compared to other methods. According to experimental results, random projection preserves distances well, but empirical results are sparse They have been applied to many natural language tasks under the name random indexing.
